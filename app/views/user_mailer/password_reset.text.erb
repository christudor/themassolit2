Over the last three weeks, we have been migrating users to a newer, faster database. As part of this, we have reset passwords across all user accounts - including yours.

Your new, randomly-generated password is: <%= @password %>

We would encourage users to <%= link_to "login to the site", "https://www.massolit.io/users/sign_in" %> and change their password to something more memorable when they have the chance.

If you have any questions regarding these changes - or any of the recent changes to the site, please do not hesitate to get in touch at chris@massolit.io.

p.s. If you haven't done so already, check out the beautiful new site at <%= link_to "https://www.massolit.io", "https://www.massolit.io" %>. Your comments and feedback would of course be very much appreciated!
