    <h1>MASSOLIT: New Password</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Over the last three weeks, we have been migrating users to a newer, faster database. As part of this, <strong>we have reset passwords across all user accounts - including yours.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    	Your new, randomly-generated password is: <strong><%= @password %></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      	We would encourage users to <%= link_to "login to the site", "https://www.massolit.io/users/sign_in" %> and change their password to something more memorable when they have the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions regarding these changes - or any of the recent changes to the site, please do not hesitate to get in touch at chris@massolit.io.
